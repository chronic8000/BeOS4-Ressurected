- How to know if my modem is supporting ACM ?
Simple : list the infos of your modem with "info" (a small tool coming with the usbkit), if there is 
interface with :
	- 1 interrupt "in" pipe (class = 2, subclass = 2, protocol = 1)
	- 1 bulk "in" pipe (class = 10, subclass = 2, protocol = 1)
	- 1 bulk "out" pipe (class = 10, subclass = 2, protocol = 1)
