Installation
Double click on the file "install".  This will copy the driver the "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin" and
link this to "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/audio/raw" and "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/audio/old"

The default configuration for the SBPro is
	I/O		0x220
	IRQ		5
	DMA8	1
	DMA16	5
	MIDI I/O	0x338

If your configuration is different, edit the file "sbpro" with the correct values and move the file to the "edit "sbpro" and move it here folder.

Bugs
Static and echos.  If anyone can help me fix these, it will be apprciated.
