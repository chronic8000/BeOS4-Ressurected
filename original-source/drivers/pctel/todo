Notes from Russ on 10/16/99
rev update 11/16/99

This driver still needs some work before
being released.

1) Performance sucks. I'm getting
   600 msec on round trip pings, I get
   300 with lucent.

a) Fixed with a rewrite of interrupt routine. We
    were looking at IIR should be looking at LSR.

2) Under the linux folder is a GPL
   header file. This must be removed!!!

a) Fixed by removing the one file and putting 
    defines in c-src files.

3) I use __GNU__ defines in a couple files
   where at pctel it's in the makefile.
   halwraps.c, pctios.c

a) Fixed by changing makefile.

4) Handle shared interrupts. 

a) Fixed. Although seems that moving
    the interrupt hook to open, does not
    answer what was wrong???
